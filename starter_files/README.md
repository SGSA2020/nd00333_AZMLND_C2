*NOTE:* This file is a template that you can use to create the README for your project. The *TODO* comments below will highlight the information you should be sure to include.


# Operationalizing Machine Learning

*TODO:* Write an overview to your project.
Cloned Github repo
log in to Azure workspace with given lab username and password
uploaded bankmarketing_train.csv
created an automated ML
selected Bankmarkting dataset
configured a new compute cluster 
run experiment using Classification and checked best model (top model)
screenshots of "Registered Datasets" in ML studio taken and experiment completed screenshot
screenshot of best model after experiment completes
best model deployed
swagger documentation
consumed model endpoints
modified scoring_uri and the key to match generated after deployment
executed endpoint.py
created, published and consumed a pipeline
uploaded jupiter notebook to the Azure ML studio
variables updated to match environment as provided
screencast- clear audio and text readable added



## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model".

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.

I tried running the project using my own account and checked that Azure ML Studio is upgraded
